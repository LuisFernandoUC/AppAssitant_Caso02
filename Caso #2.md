### Authentication platform: Auth0

For the authentication platform, we have chosen Auth0 due to its robust features and ease of integration with web applications. Auth0 meets all the required criteria being:

- It supports login and password authentication, ensuring secure access to user accounts via JWTs.
- Auth0 provides automatic screen generation or an SDK for building custom login interfaces, making it easier to implement user authentication without building the system from scratch.
- Fully compatible with React and Next.js, enabling seamless integration into the frontend of the system.
- Auth0 offers API access to authenticate users programmatically, allowing us to validate and manage users without relying on the server-side session management.
- It supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), ensuring a higher level of security. Additionally, Auth0 provides a sandbox environment that allows testing authentication flows, facilitating the development process.
