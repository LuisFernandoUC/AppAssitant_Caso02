### Authentication platform: Auth0

For the authentication platform, we have chosen Auth0 due to its robust features and ease of integration with web applications. Auth0 meets all the required criteria being:

- It supports login and password authentication, ensuring secure access to user accounts via JWTs.
- Auth0 provides automatic screen generation or an SDK for building custom login interfaces, making it easier to implement user authentication without building the system from scratch.
- Fully compatible with React and Next.js, enabling seamless integration into the frontend of the system.
- Auth0 offers API access to authenticate users programmatically, allowing us to validate and manage users without relying on the server-side session management.
- It supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), ensuring a higher level of security. Additionally, Auth0 provides a sandbox environment that allows testing authentication flows, facilitating the development process.

### Demo Code:

To test how Auth0 works and how the login screen can be customized, a demo code was used based on the selected frontend technology: **Next.js with TypeScript**.

#### 1. Creating the Auth0 Application

An application was created in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) with the following configuration:

- **Application Type:** Regular Web Application  
- **Name:** DemoCode
- **Technology Stack:** Next.js

#### 2. Configuring Callback and Logout URLs

In the application settings, the following URLs were added:

- **Allowed Callback URLs:**  
  `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`

- **Allowed Logout URLs:**  
  `http://localhost:3000`

- **Allowed Web Origins:**  
  `http://localhost:3000`

These settings allow proper redirection during the login and logout flows in development.

#### 3. Setting Up Environment Variables

The `.env.local` file was created in the root of the project with the necessary variables from Auth0:

- AUTH0_SECRET=<your-secret-generated-with-openssl>
- AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
- AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com
- AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
- AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>

#### 4. Installing the Demo Code and Dependencies

The official Next.js demo code provided by Auth0 was used. After placing the code in the project folder, the following command was executed to install the dependencies:

- npm install

#### 5. Running the Application

To launch the app in development mode, the following command was executed:

- npm run dev

This started the development server on http://localhost:3000.

#### 6. Testing the Authentication Flow
The demo application includes login and logout buttons. When clicking the Login button, the app redirects the user to the Auth0-hosted login screen. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application.

After logging in, user profile information is displayed, demonstrating that authentication was successful and session management is working correctly.

#### 7. Customizing the Auth0 Login Interface

Auth0 provides a hosted login page that can be customized directly from the Auth0 Dashboard. Here's how the customization process was carried out:

1. **Accessing the Universal Login Settings**  
   From the Auth0 Dashboard:
   - Navigate to **Branding** > **Universal Login**.
   - Select the **Login** tab.

2. **Selecting the Customization Mode**  
   Auth0 offers two modes:
   - **Classic**: Allows full customization using custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - **New Universal Login Experience**: A modern, streamlined experience with limited visual customization but easier to configure.

   For this demo, the **New Universal Login Experience** was used to keep the configuration simple and consistent with current best practices.

3. **Customizing the Login Page**  
   - The logo and primary color were changed under **Branding > Universal Login > Advanced Options > Customize**.
   - Additional UI elements like the title, background color, and button style can be adjusted using the branding options.
   - If using **Classic**, a custom HTML template can be provided to fully style the login experience.

4. **Saving and Previewing**  
   After making the desired changes, the updated login screen was previewed and saved. When logging in from the local app, the changes were reflected immediately in the hosted login page.

This process allows developers to provide a consistent and branded login experience for users without having to build a login UI from scratch.
